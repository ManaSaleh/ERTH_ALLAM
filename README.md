# ERTH - ÿ•ÿ±ÿ´

---

**ÿ•ÿ±ÿ´** (Erth) is an interactive, AI-powered character simulation that brings Saudi Arabian history to life. Centered around a writer character who narrates the story of Imam Muhammad bin Saud, the founder of the First Saudi State, this project provides an educational, engaging, and immersive experience in Saudi heritage.

## üîπ Project Highlights

- **Character Simulation**: A narrator character simulates a historian, expertly recounting the life and legacy of Imam Muhammad bin Saud.
- **AI-Driven Interaction**: Integrates IBM‚Äôs Allam, LlamaIndex, and ReActAgent with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ensure intelligent, context-aware responses.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Optimized prompts for enhanced dialogue quality and user engagement.
- **Rich Historical Coverage**: Focus on Imam Muhammad bin Saud‚Äôs contributions to unity, security, culture, and governance in early Saudi Arabia.
